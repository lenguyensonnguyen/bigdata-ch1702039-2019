       "  \"when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i didn't think much of it. at the time i was eleven years old, so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers. over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing, many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies. until two months ago i couldn't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum, i really had no intentions of watching it. but then i decided to go back and re-watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions. so i went out and bought both the original movies. and what a surprise it was to me when i was gripped by them. identity i found the superior of the two, but supremacy isn't far behind. they're both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them. because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum. and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint! <br /><br />matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies, i'd seen him in the talented mr ripley, but i never thought much of him in general. however, it appears he was born to play bourne (pardon the pun). throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see matt damon at his very best, even better than he was in the departed and i thought he was one of the best things in the departed. you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable. the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding. joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy, here she excels herself. her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie. julia stiles turns up again as nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character. julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets. david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen, he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. he's definitely the nastiest character we've met, and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty. strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, i will not say anything about the character, that's best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline. this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie. as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts. that very final scene in supremacy, in new york, a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time. won't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum. unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences. this is the part where i should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline, but i'd be lying if i didn't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases. the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time. well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series. in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in moscow. so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups, all very violent and shockingly brutal. a bike chase that is absolutely amazing, many foot chases which are even more amazing, a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable, and oh so much more! but the highlight for me has to be the scene in waterloo station, won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped.<br /><br />so any flaws for the movie? in my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you. the movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top. the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that. while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal.\",\n",

       "  '(no need to recap the plot, since others have done so already.)<br /><br />it\\'s understandable that many viewers find fault with the film, raised as we are with the slam-bang sensurround of today\\'s cineplex experience. against that background, a movie like ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet. i think there are several worthwhile reasons why.<br /><br />most importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold. together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today\\'s technology-driven cinema, where rapid-fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it. additionally, the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear, with almost no dialogue to explain what\\'s happening. this amounts to another extreme departure from today\\'s very literal fare, where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience. but perhaps most unsettling-- the movie is sometimes eerily quiet, not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be. but in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to. thus, the burden of the story is shared between the film-maker and the viewer. the former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative, while the latter must think about those visuals, since they\\'re not going to be explained.<br /><br />none of this is intended to belittle today\\'s film-making. it\\'s simply to point out that a movie like machaty\\'s comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today. i don\\'t claim either to be any better or worse. however, i do claim that ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today\\'s movie-going experience, where such \\'contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring. <br /><br />the film itself is no masterpiece, though at times it reaches artistic heights, as in the beautifully composed beer-garden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below. the slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature, and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed. these are the kind of scenes that don\\'t overwhelm you, but instead-- given half-a chance-- accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine-tingling variety of a \"jaws\". <br /><br />on the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy-handed, as when machaty piles on the imagery, particularly in the final, ode-to-labor sequence. it\\'s hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence. perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love-lorn hero and people in general-- a theme then being promoted by the influential soviet cinema. still, its presence here is rather tediously over-done.<br /><br />anyhow, i\\'ve got to admit that i tuned in initially to see the gorgeous hedy lamarr in the buff. but now i have to admit that in the process i also got a lot more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the woods.',\n",

moreover, it gives no quarter.<br /><br />\\tat an italian resort in the 1920's, alexander luzhin (john turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the world champion. luzhin is a master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family. so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament. that man is valentinov (stuart wilson), luzhin's former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin.<br /><br />\\tvalentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, turati (fabio sartor), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, natalia (emily watson). and, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life.<br /><br />\\tto tell luzhin's story, gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. and as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life. for the scenes of his childhood, gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort. the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well. she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling.<br /><br />\\tthe single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of john turturro. for this film to work, luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. it doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life. he captures luzhin's genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real. it's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, geoffrey rush's portrayal of david helfgott in `shine.' and when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from sid lidz in `unstrung heroes' to pete in `o brother where art thou?' to al fountain in `box of moonlight,' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is.<br /><br />\\tas natalia, emily watson is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin, watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story. you have but to look into watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real. it's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor.<br /><br />\\tthe supporting cast includes geraldine james (vera), christopher thompson (stassard), peter blythe (ilya), orla brady (anna), mark tandy (luzhin's father), kelly hunter (luzhin's mother), alexander hunting (young luzhin) and luigi petrucci (santucci). well crafted and delivered, `the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man. we don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us. i rate this one 9/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />\",\n",

       "  '\"the notorious bettie page\" (2005) <br /><br />directed by: mary harron <br /><br />starring: gretchen mol, chris bauer, lili taylor, sarah paulson, & david strathairn <br /><br />mpaa rating: \"r\" (for nudity, sexual content and some language) <br /><br />it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life. from ray charles to johnny cash, biopics are very posh right now. \"the notorious bettie page\" is the latest of these to be released on dvd. it features gretchen mol as the world\\'s most famous pin-up model, bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color. unlike \"ray\", \"walk the line\", and \"finding neverland\", however, this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year. this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie page\\'s life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested. this does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. in fact, \"the notorious bettie page\" is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie--a solid work of cinema. this film focuses more on page\\'s exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harron\\'s direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about.<br /><br />everyone knows bettie page (played by mol). whether you know her as an icon\\x85or a simple porn star\\x85you know her. she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time. now, most people know her as one of america\\'s first sex symbols--a legend to many models, especially those of playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and page\\'s bondage-style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar. in fact, the photos launched a full-fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn.<br /><br />the performances in \"the notorious bettie page\" are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out. her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant. i understand that, when she was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances. now, it will. she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance. david strathairn is fresh off of last year\\'s \"good night, and good luck\", in which he gave one of 2005\\'s best performances. here, he gives yet another fine performance\\x85even though he is slightly underused. i was shocked at how very limited his screen time was\\x85but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in \"the haunting\" (1999). while most people ignored the movie, i found it to be an enjoyable, if not completely shallow, horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally-distraught nell. here, taylor gives yet another credible performance. she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen mol.<br /><br />after everything was said and done, i realized that \"the notorious bettie page\" cannot be compared to other biopics, such as \"finding neverland\" and \"walk the line\". it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end. her personal life is briefly implied, but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point. we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will have\\x85but we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life. she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself. after all, she was an adult model turned christian missionary. this movie does not over dramatize anything. it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her. it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of her past\\x85and yet it does not. \"the notorious bettie page\" tells a simple story and that is something rare by today\\'s standards. fortunately, it is quite refreshing.<br /><br />final thought: \"the notorious bettie page\" is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography.<br /><br />overall rating: 9/10 (a)',\n",

they don\\'t seem to have any rapport, and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends garson or talks about their relationship. there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality-\\x97and sitting right down on the park bench to read them! i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.<br /><br />other than that, it\\'s kind of just what it seems like: a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another! and because of the whole naiveté of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years. i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays\\' female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with, and by extension convert, them.<br /><br />------ hey, check out cinema de merde, my website on bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies thrown in). you can find the url in my email address above.',\n",

what a beautiful day it is!\" <br /><br />\"la furia del hombre lobo\" was written by paul naschy in a hurry. original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by josé maría zabalza, a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production. he was often unable to work (though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script) and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited. zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschy\\'s previous movies, \"mark of the wolfman\". the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different, and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie. post production was a nightmare. nobody knew who was doing the editing, the money ran out, the master print disappeared for a while, and then at a pre-release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater. he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb.<br /><br />yet somehow the film works, if you let it. it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles, vaulted catacombs, chains, whips, gloomy moors. fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn\\'t make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution. in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning; in the next shot its bone dry and he\\'s howling at the full moon. then its raining again. and yet you don\\'t look at it as a gaffe. its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible, opposites are the same, and effects proceed causes; first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams, and then the cable starts sparking with electricity. people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness -- i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend. it is a marvel of making something out of nothing, and succeeds not because of what it could of had, but because of what it does. it\\'s easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it. the trick is being able to see through the mayhem, or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect.<br /><br />paul naschy died last week at the age of 75. he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more, was working on film projects right up until his last days, but passed away in madrid, spain, with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment. his rich, varied, and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest. and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like \"fury of the wolfman\" in rapt awe. even people who don\\'t like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at, if only for just a minute in a couple spots. you can find it for free at archive.org or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel. it\\'s worth far, far more.<br /><br />amusingly, naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted, sick, demented little movie as a classic, if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia. the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive. i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him, but i will say this: i\\'d rather watch \"fury of the wolfman\" in its dingiest, most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing, obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekend.<br /><br />the world lost a great artist this month. watch his films, and remember.<br /><br />9/10',\n",

(it\\'s more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick.) actually there isn\\'t that much sex. there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time. at least real time for an eighteen-year-old boy.<br /><br />the young man who plays andrea is fine too, which is a necessary thing, because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia. they have to carry it and they do. if it were not for their performances, i\\'m not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is. it could easily have been turned into a rather slow, boring romance.<br /><br />worth it.',\n",

bettie is frequently rejected in auditions once they realise she is the well-known pin-up girl. but we have never been asked to feel sorry for bettie page: her abusive childhood is quickly referenced and skipped over; when she is raped by four hometown lads, we see only the threat and then bettie recovering and surviving, picking herself up in deserted woodland, and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die.<br /><br />although no nudity is involved, it\\'s bettie\\'s special interest photos that eventually arouse trouble. when we go back to the court, the opinions of a clergyman on the corrupting influence of such photos are taken as evidence. a psychologist authoritatively says how the photos lead to \\'suicide, murder and psychosis\\' in youngsters who are exposed to them (presumably not in that order). eventually a star witness explains how his son\\'s life came to an end as a result of such photos - \\'being \\'trussed up like that\\'. it is not made clear how being \\'trussed up\\' causes death). the text accompanying a series of bettie\\'s photographs in a magazine tell how she was forced to endure \\'terrible agonies\\' with the fetish restraints (the audience knows that she actually found them quite hilarious and that the wordings, like the photos themselves, were pure dramatisations). after a 12hr wait, bettie is told her evidence - she is the one person who could state definitively that she was not photographed in agony - will \\'not be required\\'. the \\'horrors\\' of the photos have been proved.<br /><br />if this all sounds like the dark ages which we have left, consider a recent (2003) incident in which an ann summers advert was banned. it said, \"for fashion and passion whip along to your local store,\" with a photograph of a woman\\'s back. she\\'s wearing a bra and thong and her hands are handcuffed behind her back. the lingerie and sex toys company, that targets female consumers (and also supports charities fighting domestic violence) said its adverts aimed, \"to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality.\" one might conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the betty page investigations still holds currency.<br /><br />bettie\\'s religious views are integral to the story, just as the concept of sin is integral to christianity and contributes to the \\'forbidden\\' nature of sexual enjoyment frequently prevalent in the uk and us - as opposed to the more factual approach found in continental europe. it could be argued the formulae of sin and redemption, and \"being saved\", are even reflected in mating patterns that perpetuate traditional male dominance. a policeman making a friendly (but sexually motivated) approach to bettie outside the courtroom offers to \\'save\\' her from loneliness. the knight-in-shining-armour might be chivalrous, but it also assumes a woman in need of rescue.<br /><br />love it or hate it, the notorious bettie page is an unusual and extraordinary film, and a moral wake-up call for those that heed it. there is excellent ensemble acting, and gretchen mol, as bettie, is remarkable as the whole film succeeds or falls on her powerful performance.',\n",

<br /><br />it was in 1950/51 in the korean war that gen. macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. after outflanking the advancing north korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed, with the invading us marines suffering less then 100 casualties, back door or left hook invasion of inchon gen. macarther feeling invincible sent the us/un forces under his command to the very border, along the yalu river, of communist red china. told by his subordinates that he\\'s facing the threat of a massive ground attack by communist chinese troops gen. macarthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the us & un forces to ribbons. the unstoppable wave after wave of attacking red chinese troops forced the us/un forces to retreat in the \"big bug out\" of 1950 with their very lives, leaving all their equipment behind, across the north korean border even abandoning the south korean capital city of seoul! this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record, in the korean war, 1,000 lives on the very first day-nov. 29/30 1950-of the communist chinese invasion!<br /><br />shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, due mostly to his own arrogance, to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist chinese and noth koreans forces but his own commander and chief pres. harry s. truman, ed flanders, in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done: launch a full scale invasion of communist china with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the korean peninsula! for pres. truman who had taken just about enough garbage from gen. macarthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out, like macarthur wanted him to, against the red chinese this was the last straw! on april 11, 1951 pres. truman unceremoniously relived gen. macarthur from his command as supreme commander of the us/un forces in korea! pres. truman\\'s brave but very unpopular decision also, by not going along with macarthur\\'s total war strategy, prevented a third world war from breaking out with the soviet union-communist china\\'s ally- who at the time-like the us-had the atomic bomb! pres. truman\\'\\'s controversial decision to dump the very popular gen. macarthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his polls numbers so low-in the mid 20\\'s- that he withdrew-in march of that year- from the us presidential campaign!<br /><br />in was gen. macarthur\\'s misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars. with the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out, like gen. macarthur wanted to, against the red chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the us ussr & red china but the entire world! it was that important reality of future war that gen. macarthur was never taught, since the a and h bomb weren\\'t yet invented, in west point.<br /><br />back to 1962 we can now see that gen. macarthur, after finishing his commencement speech at west point, had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as , since his retirement from the us military, elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it. one thing that gen. macarthur was taught at an early age, from his civil war general dad douglas macarthur sr, that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last-not first-resort in settling issues between nations. in that it\\'s the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. it took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, for gen. macarthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a congressional medal of honor winner, like himself, really was!',\n",

(the other is damn yankees with gwen verdon, tab hunter and ray walston) as we all know, sometimes the luster (not to mention the songs) of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen. this is, for the most part, definitely not the case here.<br /><br />the sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can\\'t help but love them, and michael kidd\\'s choreography is absolutely stunning. (so glad to know they used the original broadway choreographer)<br /><br />all of the actors \"bounce the ball\" (that is, have unbeatable chemistry) to perfection in this film. frank and marlon are absolutely believable as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in new york, and the most notorious gambler who bets on even the most minute things-- such as his fever going up to 104 if he doesn\\'t take penicillin. sweet, fresh faced jean simmons is perfect for the role of sarah (although it is true, her singing pipes are not as outstanding as that of isabel bigley or josie de guzman)-- the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal all. and last but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is miss vivian blaine, reprising her broadway role as miss adelaide-- the hot box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to nathan with marriage, and rid herself of the psychosomatic cold he\\'s given her.<br /><br />first off, kudos to stubby kaye and b.s. pulley as they reprise their broadway roles as nicely-nicely johnson and benny southstreet. there were never two more loveable gamblers than these guys.<br /><br />brando is superb, as usual, and though he\\'s not got the voice of robert alda or peter gallagher, you forget it-- as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as sky masterson. \"luck be a lady\" gives me chills every time i see him perform the number. especially enjoyable is hearing him say \"daddy... i got cider in my ear.\"<br /><br />simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks, voice and the way she carries herself. you long so dearly for her not only to win sky (or, toward the end, believe him), but to help people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins, and live a life with god. her rendition of \"if i were a bell\" is splendid, to say the least!<br /><br />sinatra is the man. he is so perfect for the role of nathan detroit-- and here he sings parts that sam levene from the broadway cast never could (terrific actor, but the chap was tone deaf... go figure). i really enjoyed the addition of the song \"adelaide\"... wish some guy would sing like that to me. frankie\\'s cool, slick demeanor transcends the boundaries of this movie. but most importantly, you want him to marry adelaide.<br /><br />and speaking of adelaide, vivian blaine is just sheer perfection in this role. from the accent to her belting out \"adelaide\\'s lament\", she\\'s just terrific. and she\\'s also my favorite part of the entire movie. she really makes you feel for adelaide... especially when she cries right before and then again during \"sue me\". i still haven\\'t decided whether i like \"pet me poppa\" better than \"bushel and a peck\"... maybe i like them equally. either way, she does fantastic with those as well as \"take back your mink.\" (i\\'m sad that they left out \"hollanderize\" from the film...) she\\'s absolutely marvelous, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the entire film.<br /><br />one of the best things about this movie is their lingo. it\\'s a mixture of high class and street slang. never do they use \"it\\'s\", \"i\\'ll\" or \"that\\'s.\" it\\'s always \"it is\", \"i will\" and \"that is.\" overall, guys & dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals, and it\\'s one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on. my only complaint? no \"marry the man today.\" now that\\'s a good song.',\n",

(perhaps italy itself has some part in this, the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from boccaccio's decameron on tv.) generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events. this works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story. great credit is due to the director, mike newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies.\",\n",

wendy never sees anything until the film\\'s climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel\\'s many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while danny connects with the place almost immediately. his psychic powers are not in question \\x96 how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel? \\x96 but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness? it\\'s easy to claim that jack merely loses it, being trapped in a hotel with his family, and wendy later does as well \\x96 seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that \\x96 but what of danny? it appears that his body is taken over by tony, but how do we know for sure? none of these characters are reliable witnesses. hallorann probably would be, and he warns of the dangers in 237, but he\\'s killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook (a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). and that final shot. has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? has jack really been there before? or was his body merely \\'absorbed\\' into the hotel? when talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson. shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history \\x96 probably on purpose, to give jack\\'s character more of a reason to snap \\x96 and danny lloyd is no better, but jack is a powerhouse. part method, part improvisation, he\\'s simultaneously terrifying and appealing. for better or for worse, he\\'s the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid or nagging wife. we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be able to do whatever we want. who cares if it\\'s haunted? of course, the technical aspects are terrific. kubrick\\'s long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. the use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. and don\\'t even get me started on that score. i don\\'t know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself.<br /><br />i know king doesn\\'t like this film, but king\\'s input on cinema is nothing to brag about. as great of a novel writer he may be, his screenplays are terrible, and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. this is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it doesn\\'t need to be, and it really shouldn\\'t. part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn\\'t have the book to fall back on; there\\'s no reassuring source material. kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. if only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. and it\\'s got everything else on top of that.',\n",

good-bye to andy garcia in ocean\\'s 11 when they just utter each other\\'s name disdainfully. \"terry.\" \"danny.\" you can pick any number of jack\\'s performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene. these guys just have it. you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does. if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee\\'s film of the same name, you can see that there is no finer an actor working today. i don\\'t mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel\\'s work, but he is definitely the cog of the production. i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw, emotional and incendiary all at the same time.<br /><br />washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives. he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led. he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man. his friend and perhaps mentor, played very reservedly by christopher walken, is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich. apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s.e.a.l.s and such can do very well while providing a needed service. creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty. marc anthony is fine as samuel, radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita. i don\\'t know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy. the film\\'s entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role, perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly. but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role.<br /><br />it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema. together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them. tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better. i am interested to see how his next film, domino, turns out. i think scott is one of today\\'s under rated directors and with more films like this one, his name will surely be elevated to icon status.<br /><br />the story has creasy really taking to pita, and vis-ca versa. there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad, he is not around much. he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family. soon, creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition. he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear \"creasy\". it\\'s not just a friendship between them, it is more of a kinship, and a deep parental love seems to be present. <br /><br />the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her. this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion. and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force. like i said earlier, i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day, but never have i seen him like this. he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead, he becomes a literal man on fire. it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance. denzel\\'s anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita\\'s violation. this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind. <br /><br />also what is paramount to this film\\'s audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance. i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily. they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die. but not in this film. writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful. the perpetrators here feel creasy\\'s wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes. there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice. he needs information and someone loses a finger. he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things. there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film.<br /><br />man on fire is one the five best films of 2004. now that it is out on dvd, my recommendation is to get the se. it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks. 10/10',\n",

       "  'in the previews, \"the 40 year-old virgin\" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn\\'t. too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely. and then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. what\\'s more, there\\'s a movie out about it, and it\\'s called \"the 40 year-old virgin.\"<br /><br />the virgin of the title is andy stitzer (steve carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. he has a lovely home theater system and watches \"survivor\" with his two kind elderly neighbors. he\\'s a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.<br /><br />now here\\'s the real novelty with this picture: it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute, mature fashion. this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low. sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community (which are, in no way, meant to be taken as gay-bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game (\"mortal kombat: deception,\" no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys).<br /><br />as someone who is rapidly approaching 20, collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed, i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed movie could never have been. i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40. a bit arrogant, i know, but would you (\"you\" is italicized) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of \"the 40 year-old virgin\"?<br /><br />of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with \"morning rise\" (don\\'t ask), and he\\'s pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex. when it\\'s first discovered andy is a virgin, at 40, his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david (paul rudd), jay (romany malco) and cal (seth rogen) all at first assume he\\'s gay because he\\'s never been with a woman, which couldn\\'t be any further from the truth. the truth is, andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for good.<br /><br />david, jay, and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid, so help them all. but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster, as proved by one date with nicky (leslie mann), who puts andy through the worst drunk-driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth (elizabeth banks), the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.<br /><br />things brighten up for andy when he meets trish (catherine keener), the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people. hmmm. and with that nice-looking collection of action figures, you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him, that is if he can ever \"do the deed.\"<br /><br />at last, this is the sex romp we\\'ve been waiting for. it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through, not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let\\'s look at the big picture: how many of us \"lonely guys\" want to be a lonely guy forever? the important thing we\\'re taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself. i don\\'t think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does (which is side-splitting to be honest, and according to this website and various other news articles, was in fact real, and so was the blood on carell\\'s shirt afterward).<br /><br />\"the 40 year-old virgin\" was directed by judd apatow and co-written by himself and carell, which originated as a skit that starred carell. carell is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i\\'ve ever seen and is not offensive (a whole lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. even carell\\'s buddies, who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities, can be related to on a fundamental level.<br /><br />the way \"the 40 year-old virgin\" plays out is indeed funny in the end, but i\\'ll leave that up to you, the viewer, to observe. surely, if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener, then it\\'s true: it is never too late!<br /><br />10/10',\n",

       "  \"the larger-than-life figures of wyatt earp and bat masterson, and the specters of george armstrong custer and sitting bull, loom over director anthony mann's hugely entertaining first western with james stewart. although stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (john mcintire, especially great) and outlaw dan duryea, who's even more despicable than usual. the film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with mann's pared-down, compositionally rigorous film-making. his themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun, but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement, and are defined in stewart's conversations with sidekick millard mitchell. mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns. instead of gazing at vistas from afar, he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect, complicate, or evoke the human characters' goals. just as mountains, caves, and rapids had to be accounted for in the naked spur, here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain, a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters. (i would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer william h. daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day-for-night, open-range photography.) not merely an adept outdoorsman, mann presents an equally vivid picture of wyatt earp-patrolled dodge city, primarily through scaled, multiple-plane staging. the shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot. nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on the actors' eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes. one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: mitchell's telling of stewart's motivation to shelley winters, which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all. light without feeling insubstantial, intense without being overbearing, winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold.\",\n",

the lighting is his philosophy'. in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows. the hadleys house, with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way. a house that resembles a mausoleum, that no party can cheer up. as tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night, sirk's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters, and so are the colours of the clothes they wear. drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director's craft.<br /><br />sirk considered himself a `story bender', because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose. written on the wind is a good example. it wouldn't work in any other hands.<br /><br />the other director that was using similar strategies was frank tashlin, who was for 50's comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama. their films are full of the machinery of american life -advertising, tv sets, jukeboxes, washing machines, sport cars, vacuum cleaners- to depict its emptiness and decay. i'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences. the game was played by both sides, so it was camp. now we regard them as `cult' or `bizarre', because we are not those spectators anymore. that is why todd haynes's homage `far from heaven' turns into a pastiche, because it reproduces sirk's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between. then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that julianne moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film.<br /><br />sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly. there were always immovable characters (rock hudson and lauren bacall here) against which he could assemble a series of split ones. his balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters, because these are the ones sirk is interested in too. when robert stack flies the plane and `tempts' lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them (obvious faustian echoes) we are strangely fascinated with him too, as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the river.<br /><br />in the sirk's universe the studio often-imposed `happy ends' have no negative impact. in fact they worked just great. sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the deux ex machinea of his day. thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback, so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley feud.<br /><br />it was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga. i absolutely agree and i'm sure the parallel is not incidental. both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family. the temperamental son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy caan's sonny corleone. the action of fighting her sister's male friend is symmetrical. the non-son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films, as the fact that both families carry the names of their town. even details as the gate that gives access to the property, and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves, suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his masterwork. because both films deal with the subject of power: the acquisition of power, its manipulation and legacy (even kyle hadley's sterility, the event that hastens the turmoil, is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power, in this case, a weakness in sexual power). the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane. one wouldn't think at first of similarities between welles and sirk's films but there are a good many, starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family's fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne (rock hudson), as charles foster kane, was adopted by a tutor, having his own father alive. amazingly, the same actor (harry shannon) perform both wayne and kane's fathers. this detail is cannot be a coincidence.<br /><br />written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect, in execution and vision, in style and technique, a highlight in the career of this wonderful director. some say that this is his best film. in my opinion, `magnificent obsession', `all that heaven allows', `there's always tomorrow' and `imitation of life' are just as good. and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or dinasty i wish them no happy end.\",\n",

(you just know that the us military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of war-profiteering.) i especially enjoyed the character of \"omar sharif\" as played by the bulgarian actor lyubomir neikov. in one scene in which he is on the dance floor with marisa tomei he has a couple of lines that could summarize our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we install - and uninstall - in power.<br /><br />naturally, this film won\\'t appeal to everyone. if you believe that the on-going privatization of our foreign policy, the military, intelligence collection and analysis, prisons and the corrections system, public health, and a myriad of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film. if you believe, however, that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporation\\'s bottom line is an abomination i think you\\'ll find much to appreciate in this film. nothing could be more in keeping with the spirit of independence that heaping well-deserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be.',\n",

       "  \"/* slight spoilers */<br /><br />way back, before evangelion was made, before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, gunbuster was made. with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time, and the famous otakon shorts or course, gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up. it didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera.<br /><br />luckily, gainax decided to put it out as a six-part oav (direct to video) series. this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam, and many other popular space operas.<br /><br />for one, the shows starts out pretty light, with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting. noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid. this makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors. the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and noriko and kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out.<br /><br />the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. a couple more characters are introduced, and parts of noriko's past are dragged up again. besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented. smart as writer okada was, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit. in short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her. the science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where noriko, kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series.<br /><br />the animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. the designs are retro 80s style of course, but it has it's charm. animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betray<br /><br />some of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest. the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. the last episode was entirely done in black and white. while it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part.<br /><br />the music is very typical space opera fair. too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. it does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he's worked on is dragon half. if you think 80s anime music, you will know what to expect.<br /><br />as the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row. neither aspect is ever left completely out though. with the last episode in sight, noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. while they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought. the last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. again, it fits the series.<br /><br />gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. but it is done exceptionally well for a change. instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. the show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points. overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. overall, the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little. highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws.<br /><br />***/*****\",\n",

       "  '1927, and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade. now that it had become the site of a multi-million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established, some of those in the calmer quarters of this film-making factory were taking the time for a little self-reflection. the last command, while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times, frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality, and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal. it was written by lajos biro, who had been on the scene long enough to know.<br /><br />taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood\\'s most celebrated immigrants \\x96 emil jannings. before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy, being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well-timed performance, often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has-beens. he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter, and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings\\'s scenery-chomping caricatures. however, as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range, showing by turns delicate frailty, serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale. he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration (the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety), but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance.<br /><br />the director was another immigrant, albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry. nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister (the \"von\" was made up, by the way), and took a very distinctive approach to the craft. of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone, a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes. we open with a carefully-constructed chaos with movement in converging directions, which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen. then, when jannings arrives, everything settles down. jannings\\'s performance is incredibly sedate and measured, and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order.<br /><br />sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence, allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen, and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic. in fact, he really seems to have an all-round lack of interest in action. in the scene of the prisoners\\' revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance, his camera eventually retreating to a fly-on-the-wall position. compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent, which are a complex medley of point-of-view shots and intense close-ups, thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction.<br /><br />as a personality on set, it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell, and in fact powell\\'s portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on. unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with, and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones, the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired. while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically, it appears no-one told his co-stars they were not in a comedy. evelyn brent is fairly good, giving us some good emoting, but overplaying it here and there. the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself. it\\'s a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless, like a male ninotchka, but he does a good job, revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard-hearted exterior.<br /><br />the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices, as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film-making process, even a relatively tame example like this. at the very least, i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the \"behind-the-scenes\" view, as it threatened the mystique of movie-making which was still very much alive at this point. as it turned out, such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor, as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and (according to some sources, although the issue is a little vague) a nomination for best picture. this is significant, since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self-indulgent back-slapping by the hollywood elite. but elite or not, they recognised good material when they saw it, and were willing to reward it.',\n",

       "  'don\\'t get me wrong. \"goldeneye\" was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise. but the series had fallen into a fps rut. enter \"everything or nothing\", which puts bond in third-person. when i wrote my earlier review for \"from russia with love\", i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly. even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise, eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv, driving an aston martin, driving a limousine that is wired to explode, commandeering two different types of tanks a la \"goldeneye\", riding a motorcycle, flying a helicopter, repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires, and free falling after a plummeting damsel. sure, vehicle controls are a little clumsy, but the issue here is the variety.<br /><br />as movie adaptations, \"goldeneye\" and frwl were all that i could have hoped for. but eon\\'s original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure. this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe, shannon elizabeth, heidi klum, and misaki ito. judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q, respectively, and pierce brosnan, while no sean connery, adds credibility to the game\\'s proceedings. all characters resemble the stars, with the disappointing exception of heidi klum, who\\'s in-game model doesn\\'t do the real-life model justice. mya\\'s theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes.<br /><br />the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies. willem defoe\\'s character is a former colleague of christopher walken\\'s baddie from \"a view to a kill\". richard kiel appears as jaws, the hulking henchman from \"the spy who loved me\" and \"moonraker\" in three fight scenes, the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have.<br /><br />single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond. like bond, you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth, with plenty of wall and object cover. unfortunately, unlike frwl, only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging, so bond may end up crouching low when he\\'s supposed to be peeking around a corner, and vice-versa. the game also allows players to go into \"bond reflex\" mode. while you browse your inventory, everything around you will go into super slo-mo, allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. while this takes some getting used to, eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular \"bond moments\", such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath, and greatly add to the bond movie feeling.<br /><br />there are 3 available difficulty levels: operative, agent, and double oh. on operative, you can breeze through in a few hours. on agent, a few weeks. on double oh, a few months. the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear. some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints, but when all is said and done, no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie.<br /><br />multi-player, unfortunately, is not as thrilling. \"goldeneye\" still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game. eon\\'s main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond\\'s. a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date. the ending, as with most bond games, is anticlimactic. while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game, the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. also, levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. still, for any serious bond fan, not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films.',\n",

it's not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out - for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa, for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate. words are not enough, show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi.what's more, instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship, the film goes off on too many tangents, thus diluting the impact of the central theme. this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence, and yet on many occasions that's exactly what it seems like, because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment, even though much of it has no relevance to the film's basic premise - the stormy father-son relationship. so you see the problem with this film is not that it's a bad film, but it's certainly a very confused film. what happens to harilal's children after his wife's death? does he ever have relationship with them? where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba? none of these questions are answered in a film that's basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family. the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself, gandhi my father is a disappointment, no questions asked.cinematically, it struggles to translate the filmmaker's ambitious intention to the screen. practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fade-ins and fade-outs, never quite seamlessly leading into each other. on the positive side, there is inherent nobility in the film, which you recognise. the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative, trying hard not to take sides, never once judging either father or son, painting neither as the villain. what the film does do, however, is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation, but evidently alienated his family. of all the actors in the film it's only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luck-deprived harilal gandhi. it's a wonderful performance, and it's not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character. but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure. just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife's dead, and you'll realise how much he conveys through body language alone. darshan jariwala, meanwhile, who plays gandhi senior, adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years, but it's the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actor's best contribution to that role. the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba, the woman who's meant to be torn in this father-son conflict, but if she's unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then it's really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script. much effort's gone into the making of this film and that's evident throughout, but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you'll remember about it when you leave the cinema - it's just so boring.director feroz abbas khan's gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes, but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay. what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy. and with this film, the director makes us too.\",\n",

       "  '\"the last big thing\" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best...<br /><br />simon geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called \"the next big thing\". thing is, this magazine doesnt really exist, and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into pop culture. his live-in female friend, darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and simon, as well as her and her father. darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of b-rated rock bands. still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if you\\'re in the indie/art house crowd. mark my words!<br /><br />',\n",

(there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio).<br /><br />and no flat butt to boot, which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres'. mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no. 2, but from all i could see from her bikini shots, she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it.<br /><br />mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones. her bisexual nature (allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no. 2, who also happened to be her mother's lover) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses (always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason).<br /><br />mandy's uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse. if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress, i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages, especially italian and spanish - and maybe french, although i don't know if they would go for her type. but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic, and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground.<br /><br />vambo drule.\",\n",

you start with aforementioned knife(which is silent but only effective up close) and a pistol... nothing special, but good for conserving ammo, unlike the next two bad boys. your third weapon is a german smg... a sub-machine-gun. it\\'s faster and automatic, and some later enemies use it. and the last one... is nothing short of a gatling gun! oh yeah! think t2. think predator. think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun. it\\'s every bit as entertaining as it sounds. most of the boss enemies use this, though, so be prepared. i won\\'t reveal the identities of these boss enemies, however... that\\'s for each player to discover for him(or her)self. the sound is excellent... very crisp and realistic. as you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing, the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german, you truly feel like you are there, trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems. that segues me nicely into the level design... as you run through seemingly countless, nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further, you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood. i almost got motion sickness more than once(though that might also have something to do with little sleep, lots of humidity and unusual warmth...) from playing. though the level of detail isn\\'t terribly high, what there is is great. remains of victims, guards\\' quarters and countless nazi symbols... the list goes on. the game also features quite a bit of gore... for it\\'s limited graphics engine, john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game. what is there left to say... the first of its kind, and it\\'s no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters. sure, weapon bobbing and different height levels(stairs and such) didn\\'t come around until the next entry into the genre... doom... and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view(so it goes beyond simply left and right, adding vertical dimensions to it), and jumping didn\\'t come around until a third, later title(the first quake, possibly? fellow gamers, help me out here)... but all of those games, as well as the rest of the genre, owe their existence to this one. so load up the luger, open the door to enter the bunker and step into b.j.\\'s shoes... he deserves the recognition, even(or maybe even especially?) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared. i recommended this to all fans of 3d games. 8/10',\n",

unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground.<br /><br />most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film (the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation). but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm. no, this is not disney animation. no it\\'s not live action. no, it\\'s not \"cheating\" - what it is is a new, fascinating, and absolutely wonderful art form. something so fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as \"the lord of the rings\". bakshi\\'s pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, the darker of tolkien\\'s creatures, particularly the nazgul, are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish.<br /><br />peter s. beagle\\'s screenplay (based very little, as i understand it, on an early draft by chris conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien\\'s works. where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created. there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film, but there are very few changes to the storyline. there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled: the reforging of narsil, the gifts of galadriel, the huorns at the battle of the hornburg, but, again, with the time limitations he had (already the longest animated feature in history), these are certainly understandable (though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel).<br /><br />also there is the delightful (one of my favorites) score by leonard rosenman (who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv (the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work)). it is bombastic and audacious and, dare i say, perfect. it stands on it\\'s own as an orchestral triumph, but when coupled with the images of the film, it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection. so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off.<br /><br />the voice actors are wonderful. of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider.<br /><br />the character design is also wonderfully unique, though not often to everyone\\'s taste. but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he/she imagines, not what you might have imagined, and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb. this is perhaps not what you imagined, but i can only applaud mr. bakshi for showing us what he \"saw\". it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film.<br /><br />one farther word - the flight to the ford sequence, in my opinion, is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid. bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment, and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build. bakshi\\'s artistic ability and tolkien\\'s incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled.<br /><br />the recent dvd release (2001) by warner brothers, is sorely lacking. while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package is woefully short of extras. how glorious it would have been to have had a director\\'s commentary, been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release. another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over. also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film. this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score.<br /><br />of course, the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made. we will never be able to see bakshi\\'s interpretation of gondor, of shelob, of faramir, of the cracks of doom, of eowyn\\'s battle with the witch king or gandalf\\'s confrontation with him. we will never be graced with bakshi\\'s image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead. it is a shame beyond all shames that we will, in the end, have to accept peter jackson\\'s glitz and glitter hollywood, action film version of these later events in tolkien\\'s masterpiece, but, i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all.<br /><br />david',\n",

the case of cats & dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. when i heard about paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn\\'t exactly fill me with confidence. but i found the film a pleasant surprise. and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.<br /><br />a russian janitor, misha vilyenkov (tony shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. one day, he hears singing coming from the basement. and when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. and not a few phrases either. its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.<br /><br />the parrot is called paulie (voiced by jay mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in misha. wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story. which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. the two of them became birds of a feather (ok, bad pun!).<br /><br />when marie\\'s parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly. desperate to be reunited with her, paulie begins a long journey across america, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. of a cage that is!<br /><br />paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s. and although it wasn\\'t afforded the same recognition or box-office success of babe, paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.<br /><br />jay mohr\\'s stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie. he never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart aleck. paulie\\'s worldly, but he is also naive in his way.<br /><br />because he\\'s lived a rather sheltered life with marie, when he\\'s taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. and when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie, which he believes. only for those promises to be broken time and again.<br /><br />paulie is admittedly a little episodic. it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie. he first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by ivy (gena rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. she sympathises with paulie\\'s situation, and drives an rv across america to find marie.<br /><br />paulie is an occasionally very touching film. his scenes with ivy are some of the best. wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers. the way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking: <br /><br />\"there are things in life you put off, because you think you\\'re gonna do them later. but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later.\"<br /><br />the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film\\'s over.<br /><br />despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had. paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant. the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. and paulie even gets to have a romance. which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by mohr as well). that may be the only complaint i have. as soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves paulie on to another.<br /><br />the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny, but a little disturbing too. i\\'m amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film. and paulie\\'s diamond robbery is very mission impossible. he\\'s caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he\\'s remained ever since.<br /><br />the story finally comes full circle at the lab, where misha vows to help paulie. of course they do find marie. but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, i was left numb for several minutes. paulie may never get the longevity babe has, but i believe its an equally brilliant film. the same laughs. the same flawless effects. and the same surprising intelligence.<br /><br />a minor gem.',\n",

       "  'since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love. even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love, love that cannot be. the israeli filmmaker eytan fox\\' latest film \\x84the bubble\" is about that. and then it is also not. the title of the film refers to the \\x84bubble\" that is tel-aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel. the country\\'s cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn\\'t have much in common with nablus, a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film. it doesn\\'t have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoints. actually, it doesn\\'t seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it. the \\x84bubble\" of tel-aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn\\'t much different from what you may expect in any western city. teenage girls looking for britney spears\\' records, a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue, trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks, while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol. it is this \\x84bubble\" that also has the potential to lull one\\'s mind into a false sense of reality.<br /><br />the film evolves around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and, for the most part, try to stay out of politics. yelli, the camp owner and manager of \\x84orna & ella\", a hip cafe, rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the \\x84crap that surrounds them\". noam, a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store, seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations. lulu, the only female of the lot, is on the contrary linked to the israeli left, although her political activities seem to be confined to \\x84raves against the occupation\". yelli and noam naturally don\\'t object to participating in these. lulu and her political friends make t-shirts with the rave\\'s logo, put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood. their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again. the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so palestinian-friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets. in other words, predictable products of the \\x84bubble\".<br /><br />the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to nablus where we also find noam doing his reserve duty. a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel, among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance. the woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on noam\\'s doorstep in tel-aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border. his name is ashraf, he\\'s palestinian and he\\'s gay. and he hasn\\'t just come to hand back the id, he has come to see noam. without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from noam\\'s flatmates he stays. he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yelli\\'s cafe. having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew, he doesn\\'t have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity. the sky is light blue and the air is sweet. but it cannot last. for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be.<br /><br />at one point, noam and ashraf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards. they find a way of being together on another level, a metaphysical one, a level where no one else has access. this is also where our couple arrives in the end. and it couldn\\'t have been much different for them, not in today\\'s israel.<br /><br />\\x84the bubble\" is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today\\'s israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian, the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist. \\x84the bubble\" is also a beautiful film about people, gay and straight, inhabiting that strange city, tel-aviv, shown through the eyes of people who really care about them. the film\\'s premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed, but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched.',\n",

(herman left for australia after he got out of prison, to \"become human again\".) after the testament is delivered (made out to her and herman in half), maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette, and blow her and herman up. for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident. at the same time, she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true. she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore. she felt as if she had outlived herself.',\n",

(an anagram of the book\\'s title) is good enough to stand alone. i have not read hickam\\'s memoirs, but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. the film, directed by joe johnston and written by lewis colick, records the story of teenager homer hickam (jake gyllenhaal), beginning in october of 1957. it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the russian satellite sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. we see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the olga coal company. one of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. a melancholy violin tune fades with this image. we then get a jolt of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: october 5, 1957, coalwood, west virginia. homer and his buddies, roy lee cook (william lee scott) and sherman o\\'dell (chad lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. \"why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,\" questions homer. roy lee replies, \"they\\'re also the only ones who get the girls.\" homer doesn\\'t make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father\\'s footsteps as mine foreman. until he sees the dot of light streaking across the october sky. then he wants to build a rocket. \"i want to go into space,\" says homer. after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother\\'s (natalie canerday) fence, homer enlists the help of the nerdy quentin wilson (chris owen). quentin asks homer, \"what do you want to know about rockets?\" homer quickly anwers, \"everything.\" his science teacher at big creek high school, miss frieda riley (laura dern) greatly supports homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in homer\\'s basement. his father, however, whose life is the mine, does not support him. john hickam (chris cooper) believes that homer shouldn\\'t waste his time on the rockets, that the coal mines are all that matter. the coal from the mines is used to make steel, and without steel, the country would be nothing. the difficult relationship between homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film. miss riley introduces homer to the idea of entering the local science fair, with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship. \"you can\\'t just dream your way out of coalwood,\" she tells homer. homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets, improving the models with each attempt. despite the many attempts, the boys do not lose their determination. \"what are the chances of us winning that science fair,\" o\\'dell asks homer in one of their more despairing moments. \"a million to one,\" answers homer. \"that good?\" o\\'dell replies, \"well, why didn\\'t you say so?\" the music, composed by mark isham, conveys sadness and hope at the same time, especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood. rollicking 1950s\\' rock and roll, including songs by the coasters and buddy holly, occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers\\' lives with the lives of the miners. the film, photographed by fred murphy, also uses colors to set moods and symbolize. the town of coalwood, actually filmed in tennessee, is washed with blues, grays, and browns. it\\'s as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces, clothes, houses, and roads. when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys, it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company. the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red. the red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of coalwood to symbolize \"getting out\", but it is still subtle. the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of. jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal, hope, and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he isn\\'t the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film. chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homer\\'s stubborn father, who doesn\\'t recognize, or just doesn\\'t want to admit, that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive. homer, and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building, is aware that the town is dying. with the community disintegrating, the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys\\' demonstrations. again, i\\'m sure things didn\\'t happen exactly as the movie portrayed them, but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism? \"october sky\" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real.',\n",

(if you want something uplifting, see jacques rivette's fantastic céline and julie go boating, which was made around the same time). it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change.<br /><br />it involves a supposedly liberated ménage-à-trois between alexandre (played by jean-pierre leaud), marie (bernadette lafont) and veronika (francoise lebrun). yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze.<br /><br />the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave. this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. jean-pierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave, having starred (among other films) in the influential les quatres cent coups (1959) by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager. director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave, but he should be.<br /><br />there is no improvisation (unlike in john cassavetes's similar films made in the us) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. the film is resonant with eustache's personal experiences. for example, francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache. eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character marie was based on, did too. the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. this mesmerising, personal, and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around.\",\n",

what does falling in love mean to sky? i find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in, and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward sister sarah, so he does, as he\\'s promised her, need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting, make good by his \"marker,\" as he puts it, as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her. but this still denotes self-concern more than anything. however, it also allows for sarah brown\\'s own self-concern, as sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover. neither, at least it seems, will change much by their union, except perhaps in the acceptance of the other. yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition: acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other, let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by \"chemistry.\" and behind all this, i suspect is mankiewicz\\'s full knowing.<br /><br />for all those who might say, in defense of guys and dolls yet, that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth, i need only remind them cabaret, the three-penny opera, carousel, a star is born, even the sound of music, which i don\\'t care for as much (and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-cabaret musicals), all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties.',\n",

(dragon\\'s laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film, so maybe he\\'s still studying!) <br /><br />originally titled \"young master in love\", this film sees dragon (for the first sixty minutes at least) pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways. his rival for her affection is his friend (inappropriately named \"cowboy\") played comically by the longtime chan stunt-team member mars. we see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire. it is one of these scenes that we (thankfully) find \"dragon\" in over his head.<br /><br />this film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office. that said, i\\'m sure the expectations were pretty high, and i feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on it\\'s own merits. but even when i try to do this, i still feel that there is a problem with the film. it seems quite unfocused, sometimes rushed, and i think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as chan\\'s other work from this period.<br /><br />the thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence. as in \"the young master\", there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action - you really feel every blow. and again, chan goes up against the same rival from \"the young master\" (is it the same character?), and the timing and energy here is brilliant. chan\\'s style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his opponent - not just relying on pure physical ability - is as apparent here as anywhere else. the barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations. this is an absolute highlight of the film and one of chan\\'s incredible career.<br /><br />it\\'s not necessary to see the prequel before seeing \"dragonlord\", in fact, it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer. but it must be said that the original film is the superior film, and \"dragonlord\", with it\\'s focus on girl-chasing and team-sports does seem baffling. luckily, the few fight scenes it offers (plus a fantastic shuttle-cock scene) push it over the line as a must-see film in this genre.',\n",

(the original idea was for her to be topless, with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples, which indeed is the case in one brief scene.)<br /><br />lastly, several men of the cloth complained because the film was called \"tarzan and his mate\" rather than \"tarzan and his wife.\" no comment!<br /><br />of course, tarzan, who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends, comes to the rescue, routs the white hunters, and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came. the end.<br /><br />so there you have it. an utterly subversive film. like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, e.g., possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey) which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30\\'s and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code. <br /><br />the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane\\'s soprano version of the famous tarzan yell. a nice touch, which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions.<br /><br />let\\'s hear it for artistic freedom, feminist jane, and sex.',\n",

       "  \"the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger films.<br /><br />but, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality tv. it is quite different to the stephen king book, true, but i doubt whether hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form.<br /><br />but, on with the review.<br /><br />ben richards (arnold schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. the economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like jumping for dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is the running man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian (played by the entertaining richard dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.<br /><br />some, however, try and speak up against the government. when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield, california, a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. when richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. he is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (yaphet kotto) and goes on the run.<br /><br />however, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez (marita conchita alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on the running man.<br /><br />and there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode. richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of los angeles (why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. amber also becomes curious about richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed. guess what happens to her, then? so, as amber, richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop. he's super arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accent.<br /><br />yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's arnie fun. there's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('he had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. it's a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.<br /><br />if you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed. but if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it. but the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.<br /><br />if you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv. it's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv. we've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. it seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.<br /><br />with that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...\",\n",

       "  \"in 1983, director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. the result was `scarface,' starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles. the story begins in may of 1980, when castro opened the harbor at mariel, cuba, to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states. 125,000 left cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in america, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted. but not all. among the `marielitos' who streamed into florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who castro had merely wanted to be rid of. and they, too, saw america as a land of opportunity, even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier. and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana (pacino), known to his associates as `caracortada.' scarface.<br /><br />now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up, montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida, he was determined to have it all. wealth and power-- that was montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez (robert loggia). lopez, it seems, had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `little havana,' along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives. and in short order, montana sees to it that lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america.<br /><br />lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets montana and his friend, manny (steven bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work. in his day, capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: cocaine. lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be: at the `top.' with a cold-blooded, iron will, montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost. but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be the man. and he will also know whether or not it was worth it.<br /><br />in step with de palma's vision, pacino plays montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully. from the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes montana convincing and very real. what he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (de niro would be one) can. this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him. it's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.<br /><br />michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom. as elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of montana's dream, pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance. she, like pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.<br /><br />the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio (gina), miriam colon (mama montana), f. murray abraham (omar), paul shenar (sosa) and harris yulin (bernstein). an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `traffic,' and `blow,' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpah's `the wild bunch,' de palma's `scarface,' originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga. much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing. but if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end. and like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time. but the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film. i rate this one 8/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />\",\n",

       "  \"a couple of years back i had purchased (and enjoyed) the mgm double-feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies, the night stalker (1971) and the night strangler (1972). when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out, i had intended to buy it immediately – but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd-18s kept me from adding it to my collection; recently, i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak 3-discer as well.<br /><br />having watched it now, i can safely say that i didn’t regret acquiring this beloved (if short-lived) crime/horror series one bit: it may follow a standardized formula – dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak, marvelously played by darren mcgavin, gets into everybody’s hair with his attitude (flustered editor simon oakland, long-suffering colleagues, assorted authoritarian figures, a plethora of monsters and villains), faces up to the inevitable (and usually supernatural) threat alone but, finally, is pressured into keeping his story under wraps – but a winning one (further boosted by an impressive line-up of guest stars and notable behind-the-scenes credits), making the show a great deal of fun.<br /><br />that said, quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make-up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired (for instance, the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment) – not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50-minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes (in the case of the werewolf, again, he’s never seen biting anyone but, somewhat foolishly, is made to merely throw people around)! <br /><br />while the hero’s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots, there’s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, revolving around mcgavin’s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage) – to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere (the setting, for the most part, is chicago) and suspense. to make the ride even more pleasant, there’s a bouncy score by gil melle' and jerry fielding.<br /><br />for the record, the monsters encountered (but not always defeated) by kolchak throughout the series are: a revived jack the ripper, a variety of cults (voodoo, native american, aztec), aliens, vampire, werewolf (going round its over-familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise-liner!), doppelganger, satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcyclist, succubus, a knight’s armor taking a murderous life of its own (the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast – featuring john dehner as a morose police captain, hans conried and robert emhardt), helen of troy(!) and crocodile. some of the actors (other than those playing kolchak’s co-workers) return in the same roles – keenan wynn and ramon bieri (both as officers of the law), john fiedler (as a shrewd morgue attendant) and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero. if i were pressed to choose the finest (or most entertaining) episodes, i’d lean towards horror in the heights (co-starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer) and the afore-mentioned the knightly murders – while, as the weakest, i’d go for the werewolf (due to reasons i’ve already explained) and chopper (based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale!).<br /><br />unfortunately, the set contains no extras: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak: the night stalker, as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing, or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci-fi series popular today. in fact, kolchak himself – in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise – returned in a 2005 revival; this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet…but, for various reasons, i’m not sure i’d want to check it out so soon after the 1974-5 classic!\",\n",

       "  'legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world\\'s greatest fairy tales to the screen. they remain among the most popular animated films of all time. the first was his groundbreaking classic \"snow white and the seven dwarfs\" released in 1937. the last was the then-under appreciated \"sleeping beauty\" which made it\\'s debut in 1959. in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: \"cinderella\" (1950). of the three films, \"cinderella\" is the one most faithful to its origins. ironically, unlike \"snow white\", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. \"cinderella\" did not follow the same path. although it was a hit and, like \"snow white\", was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. the result was enchanting. <br /><br />a combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. ilene woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, al hoffman, mack david, and jerry livingston. when disney heard them, he knew he had found his cinderella. and indeed he had. woods heartfelt renditions of \"a dream is a wish your heart makes\", \"so this is love\" and \"oh sing sweet nightingale\" are perfect. eleanor audley, who would go on to voice maleficent in \"sleeping beauty\", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke, and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus, cinderella\\'s devoted mice. william phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and disney) veteran, verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the oscar-nominated \"bibbidi-bobbidi-boo\") her own show-stopper. <br /><br />among the artists responsible for the \"look\" of the film, was mary blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney. her elegant french-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. but, most important of all\\' are the believable characters--from cinderella, right down to lucifer, the stepmother\\'s deliciously evil cat. they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film.<br /><br />in conjunction with the film\\'s 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) \"cinderella\" has just been released on a special edition dvd. it simply has never looked better. the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful. an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well. the dvd extras, now a standard part of disney platinum editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between. but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. as usual for disney, \"cinderella\" will only be available for a limited time. so, if like me, you are a \"cinderella\" lover, get it now! this edition is truly a \"dream come true.\"',\n",

       "  \"it's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best,' whether of all time, a certain genre, or what have you, but i believe a strong argument could be made that in fact, laputa is the greatest animated film ever made. it is in my mind the masterwork of hayao miyazaki, the most talented of japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes. the version i'm reviewing is the 2003 american dub (i know, sacrilege for a hard-core anime fan to not watch it in its native language); there is at least one other english language dub out there, i have it on vhs (i have no idea from what source), and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film. but i thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.<br /><br />laputa tells the story of a boy named pazu (voiced by james van der beek here), who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named sheeta (anna paquin) literally drops from the sky. it seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent, colonel muska (mark hamill), who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck. to keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous dola (cloris leachman). the plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of laputa, a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure. it's all very much in keeping with a fairy-tale setting, but miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story, and the plot is peppered with 'gosh-wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature.<br /><br />the design work on laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary. flying machines of all sorts abound, utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking. the world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century, with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines. but it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; laputa is both the garden of eden and the fire of heaven itself, and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal, its power, and its danger.<br /><br />besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film, laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography. from sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one-man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, laputa displays a scope that most films \\x96 even with the magic of cgi \\x96 can only daydream about. though we only see a small fraction of this world, its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it. the film also contains one of my favorite, if not the most exciting, action sequences ever: a guardian robot that fell to earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in, all the while trying to protect sheeta (who was the one who woke it up). meanwhile, pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her, literally, from the jaws of destruction. from the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last-second rescue, the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience.<br /><br />it helps that laputa has an amazing score. composer joe hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world, the dewy innocence, the exciting action, and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians. though he re-recorded it for this dvd release (which imo is not an improvement over his original score), adding pieces here and there, the score matches the visuals perfectly, a rare total union of sound and vision.<br /><br />this isn't a bad dub. i'm inordinately fond of the older english dub, and this one over-explains things just a tad in spots, but i was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those (and those matched the japanese pretty well). dola in particular is hard to get right, but leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman (her sons aren't quite as good as the original). paquin does a good job as sheeta, and mark hamill, while i knew it was him early, is more than talented enough to do muska (i liked the other english dub of muska a little more, but hamill's good). much of the film rests on pazu's shoulders, and van der beek is wonderful. listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other english dub, because vdb matches up very closely with the original pazu. although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful, as much as i love this film, i don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular anglicized version. john lassiter of pixar introduces it up front, and my suspicion is that he, like so many others, simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality.<br /><br />miyazaki has had success in america in recent years with spirited away and mononoke (one of his few films i didn't care for), but to me laputa is still his crowning achievement. anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work, and again, this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder. i'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen, it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on dvd.\",\n",

       "  \"joshua seftel's first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about just as the title suggests: the corporations effect on war.<br /><br />the film is about a mercenary (john cusack) traveling to turaqistan (not a real country, fyi) to help the american government 'get their message across' to turaqistan's leaders. he meets a reporter (marisa tomei) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter. somewhere in the mix, a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in. as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan's most important people (a son of the president), a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star, well, somewhat. the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar; no more than fifteen seconds later, the film hooks you. with it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics, the film's running time blows by you. the film has a lot more action than i expected, with the occasional scene of war, well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder. though the story isn't much deep, the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike.<br /><br />in the final act of the film, the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled. i thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and i could understand why. twist after twist is what the ending is all about, and like most films, it is a true hit/miss situation. regardless, the three writers on the film (mark leyner, jeremy pikser & john cusack) did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation overseas.<br /><br />joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the film's integrity; not reducing the material to the most redundant of films (which i was afraid would happen). seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could: he created a vibrant atmosphere, one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all. seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. no missteps here. hopefully, he takes on more directorial jobs, for he is one director to look out for.\",\n",

       "  \"'the last wave' is far more than the sum of its parts. it's not merely a disaster film, not simply an exploration into australian aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama. writer/director peter weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'picnic at hanging rock' two years earlier, that you will continue to remember years later.<br /><br />when lawyer david burton (chamberlain) is called to defend chris lee (gulpilil) over the death of an aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible, he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from lee, but making sense of what he hears when it does come. as with the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with ramifications more disastrous than burton could ever have imagined.<br /><br />no doubt the reason why 'picnic at hanging rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery. we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves. in 'the last wave', we can piece everything together by the end of the film. however, even with all the information, we have to choose how much of it we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities.<br /><br />on the production side, weir uses his budget to great effect, progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting, to heavy rain, to good use of sound. the incidental music is unobtrusive, never trying to be grandiose. richard chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery. david gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but afraid because he already knows the ending.<br /><br />put all these things together, and you have a perfect example of why david weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on. strongly recommended.\",\n",

(ending? watch for yourself!)<br /><br />overall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again. although this is hard to find (i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd) it is definitely worth your money.\",\n",

       "  'beforehand notification: i\\'m sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here, but when i saw the preview for this movie, i was thinking \"finally!\" i have yet to see one movie about popular african-influenced dance (be it popular hip hop moves, breaking, or stepping) where the main character was a black woman. i\\'ve seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it (breakin, breakin 2, save the last dance, step up), but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent. that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop, african-influenced dance, and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn\\'t always men who performed it, so i felt this movie has been a long time coming. however, the race does not make the film, so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch.<br /><br />pros: i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture. i can\\'t recall ever seeing a popular, mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican; had believable accents; and weren\\'t stereotypical with the beanies. the steppers, family, friends, and even the \"thugs\" were all really intelligent, realistic people who were trying to love, live, and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive. even when the audience was made aware that the main character\\'s sister chose an alternate lifestyle, it still didn\\'t make the plot stereotypical. i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed. i loved the stepping; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers; the trials that the main character\\'s parents were going through; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel. i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time, and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world. they were all just as excellent as the fellas. i don\\'t see that in too many movies nowadays, at least not those that would be considered black films.<br /><br />cons: i\\'m not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this, but i question whether they\\'ve been to real step shows. whenever the steppers got ready to perform, some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers\\' hand/feet beats. at a real step show, there is zero need for music, other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups. and then when hip hop songs were played, sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers\\' hands and feet. it was awkward. i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus \"stomp the yard\" (another great stepping movie) because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys (in \"stomp the yard,\" meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the (deltas?) let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately). even when there were very small scenes, the ladies tore it up, especially in the auto shop, and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music. i know soundtracks have to be sold, but the movie folks could\\'ve played the music in other parts of the film.<br /><br />i\\'m not a keyshia cole fan, so every time i saw her, all i kept thinking was \"is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks?\" she looked uncomfortable on screen to me. i thought they should\\'ve used a host like free or rocsi instead. deray davis was funny as usual though. also, i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto, like stepping couldn\\'t possibly happen anywhere else. hollywood, as usual. however, only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers, which mainstream movies tend to do.<br /><br />i would\\'ve given this movie five stars, but the music playing killed it for me. i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs.',\n",

       "  'by 1987 hong kong had given the world such films as sammo hung\\'s `encounters of the spooky kind\\' chow yun fat in john woo\\'s iconic `a better tomorrow\\', `zu warriors\\' and the classic `mr vampire\\'. jackie chan was having international success on video, but it was with `a chinese ghost story\\' that hk cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the west for many years.<br /><br />western filmgoers had never seen anything like it. it was a film that took various ingredients that hk cinema had used for years (flying swordsman, wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural) and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look, feel and execution. forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned, this is the original and best.<br /><br />director siu-tung ching (still best known as an action choreographer on such films as woo\\'s `a better tomorrow 2\\'/\\'the killer\\') has, under the watchful eye of legendary producer tsui hark, created a masterpiece of fantasy/horror cinema. and with such an expert crew at his disposal (no less than 6 martial arts coordinators) the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable.<br /><br />the editing by the amazingly prolific david wu (who wrote/directed `the bride with white hair 2\\' and edited such classic titles as `a better tomorrow 1/2/3\\', `hardboiled\\' and the cult hit `the club\\') is quite simply a work of genius. his crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying, tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best hk cinema has ever created. fast moving, outlandish but never confusing they are, even today, the pinnacle of their art.<br /><br />the crew of cinematographers have also done miracles. this is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting. where wonderful blue tinged night sequences, shrouded in an ever-present ghostly fog, are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold. it\\'s a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty. even the silken robes and dresses worn by hsiao tsing become living parts of the movie, whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen. even a simple scene where hsiao tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act. the sets are also amazing, giving an other worldly sense to the forests, and the temple and harshness to the scorched, flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale. the production design by zhongwen xi deserves the highest praise.<br /><br />another major factor to the films success is the music by romeo diaz and james wong. hong kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence, but on `a chinese ghost story\\' the music is, quite simply, vital. from the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters.<br /><br />the score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments. drums, bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect, but it\\'s in the slower, achingly romantic pieces that it comes into it\\'s own. here; flutes, strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an hk film. add to this the female vocal, stunningly beautiful song that plays over tsau-shen\\'s and hsiao tsing\\'s love making, (nothing is ever seen, but the effect is wonderful. this is lovingly innocent movie romance) and you have a shining example of the power a film\\'s music can have.<br /><br />and we of course have the acting talent. leslie cheung (`a better tomorrow 1 & 2\\' and a very popular singer) is outstanding as the innocent tax collector. his work in the (thankfully mild) comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with joey wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence.<br /><br />joey wang (who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the chow yun fat/andy lau classic \"god of gamblers\") has never looked more radiant than how she does here. she is the epitome of ethereal beauty. her portrayal of the tragic hsiao tsing is stunning. she shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do, but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths. veteran actor wu ma (`mr. vampire\\', `swordsman\\') is great fun as the wise, brave, but ever so grumpy, yen. he treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease. and what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable.<br /><br />but what about the monsters and beasties?, i hear you cry. well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion/animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting tsau-shen), to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective lord black. complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads, and quite outstanding wire work. most of which has, to this day, never been topped.<br /><br />but the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirit\\'s killer tongue. we first encounter this thing with an `evil dead\\' style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal french kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks. but later it\\'s shown in all its crazy glory. it can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey, rips apart trees, wraps itself around buildings and coils it\\'s slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks!! it can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth! it\\'s an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldn\\'t work. but it does, to fantastic and unforgettable effect.<br /><br />so what all this adds up to is a classic example of hong kong movie making. a true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie. it\\'s a film packed with wit, invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, lush visuals, beautiful music, and most important to it\\'s enduring charm, one of cinemas most moving romances.',\n",

       "  'it\\'s difficult to not have a liking for israeli director eytan fox and for his movies, which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these regions. besides he also gave voice to the young generations, and to the remarkable part of them, who really need peace and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people, both in israel both in palestine. these reasons, in my opinion, are sufficient to consider fox a noteworthy director, even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control. however the fans of his movies (that he realized on team with gal uchovsky, his producer, co-screenwriter and also life companion) seem to not being vexed by this, since his new feature, the bubble (ha-buah), is having the same success of the previous yossi & jagger and walk on the water. announced as a contemporary gay version of \"romeo & juliet\", set in the present day tel aviv instead of verona and with two men (one israeli and the other palestinian) at the place of the two shakespearean young lovers, the film actually is quite different from that or, better, it\\'s also something else. in fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man, noam, played by the fox regular ohad knoller (yossi in yossi & jagger, but i must confess i miss jagger, the astonishing yehuda levi!) and his two co-tenants, a guy and a girl, chose to live. around thirty-years-old, restless, witty and firm (despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a checkpoint on the frontier with the palestine) to live a life that won\\'t be only made of war. the two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other. their lives are destined to change when noam falls in love with ashraf (the tv star yousef \\'joe\\' sweid) a young palestinian who came to live in tel aviv. the laws so far in force among the group are neglected, but not the will to aid one friend. still it won\\'t be easy for noam and his friends, \\'cause ashraf is clandestine in israel and in the meantime his family, who lives in palestine and doesn\\'t know he\\'s gay, is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl, who is a relative of ashraf\\'s beloved sister bridegroom-to-be, who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong liability in the development of the plot, with consequences not just for the two men. because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace (interesting dualism, if not automatic) are stubborn and so the tragedy is unavoidable. even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between noam and ashraf meets with, it doesn\\'t the overlook the other characters, which turn out well written (for example golan, the boyfriend of yelli, noam\\'s fellow tenant, introduced as a lively boor, and then disclosed as a sweeter and more open minded person) and aptly performed (besides the two leads, we mustn\\'t disregard the funny zohar liba and the lovely daniela virtzer, the girl of the gang; moreover late marriage\\'s star lior ashkenazi appears as himself in a cameo). it also melds the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones, even if the director can\\'t do without a melodramatic conclusion. i watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime i often thought about it, proof that fox and his pal have a knack to strike home.',\n",

(which is unique among allen's work) along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson. scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop's most enjoyable aspect. the plot revolves around johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. she falls in love with a suspected serial killer (jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen.<br /><br />i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johanson's performance but i am a bit bias, i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. she plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character. she adds appropriate body language for comic effect. needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus.<br /><br />allen is allen... he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character. something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late...<br /><br />jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less.<br /><br />in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh... in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion. johanson and allen are more detective-like than anything. however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film. instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners. i did find his allusions to his last film interesting... come for the humor, laugh and be merry.<br /><br />needless to say if you enjoy allen's work watch it. if not watch something else...\",\n",

       "  'anchors aweigh is an entertaining mgm musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but i wouldn\\'t rate it up there with classics like singin in the rain or the band wagon. this was the first of three musicals that gene kelly and frank sinatra appeared in together. kelly and sinatra play joe brady and clarence doolittle, two sailors on leave in hollywood who befriend a young boy (dean stockwell)who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (kathryn grayson) a struggling actress who is working as an extra at mgm. though both guys are initially attracted to grayson, she eventually voices a preference to joe but clarence later hooks up with a waitress (pamela britton)who, he learns is from his hometown of brooklyn. the paper-thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including \"we hate to leave\", joe and clarence\\'s lament to their fellow sailors as they\\'re leaving the ship; grayson\\'s torrid rendition of \"jalousie\"; sinatra\\'s dreamy rendition of \"i fall in love too easily\" (a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film), and \"the worry song\", a fantasy dance that kelly does with animated jerry the mouse from tom and jerry fame. kelly also does a sort of kissing bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his pirate\\'s ballet in the later the pirate. kelly is in peak form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only oscar nomination for best actor and sinatra\\'s endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy. an entertaining diversion for fans of the mgm musical factory.',\n",
